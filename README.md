# tdd - test-driven development

I had finished reading a TDD guide-book and wanted to test my new knowledge creating a new app all by myself, using TDD practices. Most of the code in this project is tested: models, views, urls, forms, templates. It does not have functional tests, thought.

This project was made for practice purposes only, there's no real utility in this app.

The app contains a 'student form', you can enter yoyr 'student information', and then a card containing all the information is created and saved into the database.You then can check all these student cards in the homepage, or check their specific information by going to their detail page. There's no authentication system.
